**Mapping the Attack Surface**

Mapping the attack surface is the final and critical stage in application mapping. This step focuses on identifying every type of exposed functionality and behavior that could introduce vulnerabilities. By linking components to known classes of bugs, you can prioritize your testing and prepare targeted attack strategies.

### Common Attack Surface Elements and Associated Vulnerabilities

* **Client-side validation**: Easily bypassed; server-side replication often missing.

  * *Vulns:* Business logic abuse, XSS, SQLi

* **Database interaction**:

  * *Vulns:* SQL injection

* **File upload/download**:

  * *Vulns:* Path traversal, unrestricted file upload, stored XSS

* **Display of user-supplied data**:

  * *Vulns:* Cross-site scripting (XSS)

* **Dynamic redirects**:

  * *Vulns:* Open redirection, HTTP header injection

* **Social networking features**:

  * *Vulns:* Username enumeration, stored XSS

* **Login functionality**:

  * *Vulns:* Username enumeration, weak password policy, brute force attacks

* **Multistage authentication**:

  * *Vulns:* Logic flaws in auth flow (e.g., bypassing second factor)

* **Session state management**:

  * *Vulns:* Predictable session tokens, insecure session handling

* **Access controls**:

  * *Vulns:* Horizontal and vertical privilege escalation

* **User impersonation features**:

  * *Vulns:* Privilege escalation, session fixation

* **Cleartext communications**:

  * *Vulns:* Session hijacking, interception of credentials or PII

* **Off-site links**:

  * *Vulns:* Referrer leakage exposing sensitive parameters

* **Interfaces to external systems**:

  * *Vulns:* Inconsistent access/session handling, trust boundary violations

* **Error messages**:

  * *Vulns:* Information disclosure, stack traces, tech fingerprinting

* **Email functionality**:

  * *Vulns:* Email injection, command injection

* **Native code modules or integration**:

  * *Vulns:* Buffer overflows, memory corruption

* **Third-party components**:

  * *Vulns:* Known CVEs or insecure default configurations

* **Identifiable server software**:

  * *Vulns:* Known bugs, default misconfigurations

### HACK STEPS

1. **Understand Core Features & Security Controls:** Get familiar with the appâ€™s key workflows and protections.
2. **Flag Vulnerable Functionalities:** Match behavior (e.g., login, file upload) with known vulnerability types.
3. **Research Third-Party Code:** Use public CVE databases (e.g., osvdb.org) to check for known exploits.
4. **Prioritize Testing:** Focus on components with high-risk functionality and easy exploitability.

### Summary

A thorough attack surface map directs your offensive efforts to where they matter most. It maximizes your time and effectiveness during security assessments. Combine manual inspection, automated assistance, and vulnerability knowledge to uncover the highest-impact flaws efficiently.
