# Extrapolating Application Behavior

Applications often exhibit consistent behavior across different functions due to shared design patterns, coding practices, or common libraries. By identifying behavior in one area, it's sometimes possible to extrapolate assumptions or testing strategies that apply to other areas. This technique is valuable in bypassing input validation, decoding obfuscated data, and understanding internal structure through inconsistent error handling.

### Leveraging Consistent Input Handling

---

In many applications, global input validation logic may be implemented—filtering or sanitizing user input before it reaches business logic components. Understanding this logic in one function can help exploit vulnerabilities elsewhere:

* For instance, if you've identified a **blind SQL injection** but suspect the payload is being filtered or modified, look for functions that **echo back user input** to observe how it is processed or encoded.
* By systematically testing various encodings and bypass techniques (e.g., Unicode, URL encoding, comment injection), you may determine what raw input will survive sanitization and ultimately be interpreted by the back-end.
* If the same validation scheme is applied globally, you can reuse this insight across multiple features of the application.

### Decoding Custom Obfuscation Schemes

---

Some applications use **client-side obfuscation** for data like cookies or hidden fields to discourage tampering. While these schemes may appear opaque, you can sometimes reverse them using application features:

* Look for functions that **decode or reflect** obfuscated values in responses—such as error messages or logging features.
* If the same obfuscation logic is used across components, you might extract and decode values from one location (like a session token) using functionality from another (like an admin error message).
* You can also reverse-engineer the obfuscation by submitting **controlled variations** and observing how the deobfuscated output changes.

### Exploiting Inconsistent Error Handling

---

Error handling is often applied unevenly across an application. Some components handle errors gracefully, while others may:

* Crash and display **verbose stack traces**
* Reveal internal logic, such as file paths, SQL queries, or application structure

By comparing these behaviors:

* Use lenient areas to learn about **class names, SQL syntax,** or **parameter expectations**.
* Apply this knowledge in more secure areas to craft more effective test cases.

### HACK STEPS: Behavioral Extrapolation

1. **Locate feedback-rich components:** Identify parts of the application that reflect input, return verbose error messages, or handle encodings.
2. **Test for consistent sanitization:** Use one component to refine payloads for use in more restricted ones.
3. **Explore decoding vectors:** Identify areas that may reveal obfuscated data, and test systematically to reverse the scheme.
4. **Compare error behaviors:** Leverage detailed errors in some modules to infer behavior in tightly controlled ones.

# Isolating Unique Application Behavior

In some cases, the opposite approach is needed: identifying **inconsistencies** or **anomalous behavior** that signals a weak link. Modern or well-hardened applications may use uniform frameworks that enforce standard security practices across all components. However, vulnerable code is often found in:

* **Retrofitted features** not fully integrated into the main framework
* **Third-party components** or quick fixes
* **Debugging interfaces** left exposed

Such areas often:

* Have inconsistent **parameter names**, **navigational flows**, or **GUI styling**
* Lack full implementation of **authentication**, **authorization**, or **session control**

---

### HACK STEPS: Isolating Weak Points

1. **Identify design inconsistencies:** Watch for deviations in GUI, naming conventions, or endpoint structure.
2. **Flag non-core functionality:** Examples include CAPTCHAs, analytics tools, test harnesses, or support widgets.
3. **Audit these areas independently:** Do not assume the usual security mechanisms (e.g., input filtering, authentication checks) are applied to these segments.

By combining behavioral extrapolation and anomaly detection, testers can systematically map secure and insecure zones within an application, leading to more efficient and targeted exploitation strategies.
