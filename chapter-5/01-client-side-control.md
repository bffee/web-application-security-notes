**Bypassing Client-Side Controls: Transmitting Data Via the Client**

Client-side controls are fundamentally insecure because the user has complete control over the client and the data it sends to the server. Relying on controls that are implemented only on the client side (and not replicated or enforced on the server) introduces serious vulnerabilities.

### Types of Client-Side Controls

Applications may depend on the client side in two main ways:

1. **Transmitting Data via the Client:**

   * The application sends certain values to the client, expecting them to be returned unmodified.
   * These values may not be visible to the user (e.g., hidden fields, cookies, custom headers), but are still fully controllable by the client.

2. **Controlling User Interaction via the Client:**

   * Using HTML forms, JavaScript, or browser extensions to control the user's inputs or restrict access to certain functionalities.

### Transmitting Data via the Client: The Developer’s Assumptions

Applications often pass data to the client and read it back later, assuming it remains trustworthy. However, since users control all client-side communication, these assumptions are false and dangerous.

### Why Developers Use This Pattern

Despite the risks, developers commonly use this pattern for various practical reasons:

* **Avoid Session Tracking Overhead:**

  * Reduces the need to manage user state and session storage on the server.

* **Multi-Server Architecture:**

  * When requests are handled by different backend servers, it’s easier to pass state through the client instead of synchronizing it server-side.

* **Third-Party Server Components:**

  * In cases where third-party server-side tools (e.g., shopping carts) are hard to modify, passing data through the client is the only practical option.

* **Change Management Constraints:**

  * Avoids the need for server-side API changes and testing cycles by shifting new data flows to the client.

### The Security Problem

This practice introduces vulnerabilities because:

* **Users Can Modify Data:**

  * Hidden fields, cookies, query parameters, or JavaScript variables can all be tampered with.

* **No Validation Equals No Trust:**

  * If the server does not validate or enforce data integrity, attackers can inject manipulated values to escalate privileges, change prices, impersonate users, or bypass restrictions.

---

### Key Takeaway

Never trust data that originated from the client—even if it was generated by the server in a previous request. Every piece of client-supplied data must be validated and controlled server-side.

> **Security Principle:** *Trust nothing from the client. Always verify and enforce all controls on the server.*
