# Securing Authentication

Implementing a secure authentication mechanism involves balancing multiple, often conflicting goals. Enhancing security may negatively impact usability or increase implementation costs. In some cases, excessive security measures may even backfireâ€”for example, overly strict password policies often cause users to write down their passwords.

## Key Trade-Off Considerations

To strike an effective balance between security, usability, and cost, the following factors should be considered:

- **Security Criticality**: How sensitive is the functionality and data being protected?
- **User Tolerance**: To what extent will users cooperate with strong authentication requirements?
- **Support Costs**: What is the cost of maintaining a system that is less user-friendly?
- **Financial Viability**: Is it cost-effective to implement stronger alternatives based on the value of protected assets?

In many real-world cases, application designers accept certain threats as inherent risks and focus on defending against the most serious ones.

# Use Strong Credentials

Strong credentials form the foundation of secure authentication. The following practices are recommended:

## Password Requirements

- Enforce a minimum length.
- Require inclusion of:
  - Alphabetic characters
  - Numeric characters
  - Typographic/special characters
  - Both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Prevent use of:
  - Dictionary words
  - Common passwords
  - Names
  - Passwords identical to the username
  - Passwords similar to previously used ones

> **TIP:** Different user types may justify different password complexity rules depending on the access and risk level.

## Username Management

- Ensure all usernames are unique.
- For system-generated credentials:
  - Use random generation with sufficient entropy.
  - Prevent generation patterns that could be guessed, even with access to a large number of samples.

## Password Flexibility

- Allow users to set long passwords.
- Support a wide range of allowable characters for increased password strength and flexibility.
