# Insecure Distribution of Credentials

Some web applications distribute newly created user credentials through **out-of-band channels**, such as **email, SMS, or postal mail**. While this approach can add verification of the user's contact details, **it can also introduce critical security risks**, especially when credentials are exposed or mishandled in this process.

---

## Why This Is a Problem

### 1. Credentials Persist in Insecure Channels
- If **both username and password** are included in the distributed message:
  - Users often **don’t change** their initial password.
  - Messages may **persist** in inboxes or other storage.
  - **No expiry** of credentials leads to **long-term exposure**.
  - Unauthorized users accessing the channel can **compromise accounts easily**.

### 2. Account Activation URLs Can Be Predictable
- Some applications use **activation links** instead of sending credentials.
- If the **URLs follow a sequence**, an attacker can:
  - Register multiple users rapidly.
  - Identify the **pattern** of the activation links.
  - **Predict URLs** for other users and hijack accounts before activation.

### 3. Login Credentials Sent After Account Creation
- Some applications send login credentials **after registration** via email.
- Worse yet, they may **email newly changed passwords** for “future reference.”
- This introduces long-term **storage of sensitive credentials** in insecure locations.

## HACK STEPS

1. **Create a new user account**:
   - Observe whether the application **assigns credentials** or requires you to choose them.

2. **Determine how credentials are distributed**:
   - Check email, SMS, or web-based activation URLs.
   - If an activation link is used:
     - Register **several users quickly** and collect the URLs.
     - Look for **incremental or predictable patterns**.

3. **Predict future or past URLs**:
   - Based on the observed pattern, try to access **recent or future user accounts**.

4. **Test URL reusability**:
   - Attempt to use the **same activation URL multiple times**.
   - If denied on the second use, try **locking the account** and then **reusing the URL**.

## TIP

Insecure distribution methods often **persist in inboxes or logs**, exposing credentials to insider threats or malware. If passwords are included in emails or SMS without **forced password change**, users should assume the account is compromised — especially in corporate or public environments.

| Vulnerability Type              | Description                                                                  | Exploitable For                 |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Credentials in email/SMS       | Initial username/password sent directly                                     | Credential reuse, account takeover |
| Predictable activation URLs     | Sequential or guessable links allow takeover of other accounts              | Pre-activation account hijack    |
| Resend or echo of new password | Application emails the password again after change                          | Long-term credential exposure    |
| Reusable activation URLs        | Same link works multiple times or after account lockout                     | Account compromise               |
