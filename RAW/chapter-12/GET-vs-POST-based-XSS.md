### 🧩 First, Let’s Clarify the Two Parts:

#### **1. GET-Based XSS** Example:

```html
<img src="https://vuln.site/page?msg=<script>steal()</script>">
```

* This works because:

  * The payload is in the **URL query**.
  * The browser makes a **GET request** to that URL automatically when loading the `<img>`.
  * No user interaction needed.
  * If the page at `/page` is vulnerable to reflected XSS via the `msg` parameter, it will execute.

✅ **Passive XSS execution** — just loading the image tag in another site can trigger it.

---

#### **2. But What If the XSS Requires a POST Request?**

> That’s where things get trickier — and where your confusion is valid.

Here’s what it means:

Some XSS vulnerabilities only occur **when data is submitted via a POST request**, not a GET.

##### 🔻 Example:

The vulnerable app expects this:

```http
POST /submit HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

comment=<script>steal()</script>
```

So, if the XSS only triggers when the script is in the **body of a POST**, then this:

```html
<img src="https://vuln.site/submit?comment=<script>steal()</script>">
```

**won’t work**, because `<img>` always makes **GET requests**, and here the server expects a **POST**.

---

### 🧠 So, No — it’s *not* referring to Stored XSS directly.

It's about the **request method** needed to trigger the XSS.

Even a **reflected XSS** could require a POST request.

---

### 🤔 Why Would a Site Require POST for Reflected XSS?

Because the devs built a form that:

* Accepts user input via POST only (e.g., comment form).
* And reflects that input into the response.
* But doesn’t accept input via GET params at all.

So even if the app reflects input back unsafely (which creates reflected XSS), you can't trigger it with just a link or image — because it’s a **POST-only endpoint**.

---

### 🔐 Why Is This Important?

* POST-only XSS is **harder to exploit**:

  * You **can’t use `<img>`, `<script>`, or `<iframe>`** to automatically trigger it.
  * You need a more complex exploit, like:

    * A **CSRF form** that auto-submits.
    * A **JavaScript-based attack** (if you can inject elsewhere).
    * Or **trick the user** into submitting the form.

---

### 🛠️ Example of Exploiting POST-Based XSS (CSRF Style)

```html
<form action="https://vuln.site/submit" method="POST" style="display:none" id="xssForm">
  <input name="comment" value="<script>steal()</script>">
</form>

<script>document.getElementById('xssForm').submit();</script>
```

* Host this on a malicious site.
* If the user visits your page while logged into `vuln.site`, the form auto-submits → XSS triggers.

✅ Works around the POST limitation.

| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<img src=...>` with XSS                   | Only works for **GET-based reflected XSS**                                         |
| POST-only XSS                              | Still **reflected**, but input must go in the **body**, not URL                    |
| Can POST-based XSS be exploited passively? | Not easily — it requires form auto-submission, user interaction, or another vector |
