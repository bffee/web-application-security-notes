### ✅ 1. What does `..\` mean in Windows?

> *“..\ means going one step back in directory in windows.”*

Correct. It’s the Windows **directory traversal operator**, equivalent to:

* `../` on Linux/Unix

Every pair of `..\` climbs **one directory up** in the file tree.

### ✅ 2. Juicy File Targets (OS Agnostic)

> *“config files, log files, source code, and SSH keys...”*

Perfect — and here’s a list you can mentally quick-fire during recon:

#### 🔐 Common File Targets:

* **Linux:**

  * `/etc/passwd` → user accounts
  * `/etc/shadow` → password hashes (if accessible)
  * `/var/log/auth.log`, `apache2/access.log`
  * `.bash_history`, `.ssh/id_rsa`
  * `.env`, `config.php`, `wp-config.php`

* **Windows:**

  * `C:\windows\win.ini` (safe probe file)
  * `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config`
  * `C:\Program Files\App\config.ini`
  * `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\...`

---

### ✅ 3. Bypassing `../` Filters

> *“we can bypass basic filter of ../ by using url encoding.”*

Exactly — and here are some **bypass variants** you should have in your mental payload bank:

#### 🔁 Bypass Payload Examples:

* `%2e%2e%2f` = `../`
* `%2e%2e/` = `../`
* `..%252f` = `../`
* `....//` = double traversal
* `..%c0%af` = Unicode-encoded slash (legacy trick for older servers)

> ⚠️ Some WAFs decode **once** or **twice**, so chaining multiple encodings like `%252e%252e%252f` (double-encoded) often works.

---

### ✅ 4. Testing for Vulnerable File Parameters

> *“...by requesting files which is accessible by every user such as win.ini...”*

Perfect. That’s how you do a **non-destructive test** in real-life scenarios.

Use:

* `win.ini` (Windows)
* `/etc/passwd` (Linux)

Why? These files:

* Always exist
* Are world-readable
* Don’t break anything
* Leak sensitive info in response (usernames, configs, etc.)

---

### ✅ 5. Why It’s Still Dangerous with Low Privileges

> *“...we can still read config files, log files which can be used to find other vulnerabilities...”*

Exactly.

**Privilege ≠ Safety** when:

* You can **read .env/configs** → credentials
* You can **read source code** → find hardcoded secrets, API keys
* You can **read logs** → potentially inject into them, then combine with LFI for RCE

### 🔄 Example Attack Chain:

1. Path Traversal → read access logs
2. Inject malicious payload into logs via User-Agent
3. Use LFI → include log → RCE
4. Now you’ve escalated from LFI to full remote shell.

### 🧠 Side Note for You (Bonus Tactic)

> If a web app uses a **wrapper endpoint** like:

```
/get-file?name=cat.jpg
```

Always test for traversal by:

* Submitting `../../../etc/passwd`
* Encoding it as: `%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd`
* Or even tricking the parser with: `....//....//etc/passwd`
