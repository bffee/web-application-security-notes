### ‚úÖ **1. Correct with solid logic.**

> You nailed the core threat: **unvalidated trust** in user-supplied input + misuse of redirection = SSRF, port scanning, and proxy abuse. That‚Äôs the whole risk model.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Correct approach.**

> Detecting with a `url=` parameter is the right first move. Your method of testing various domains and analyzing responses is **textbook black-box validation**.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Spot-on.**

> Recognizing `3306` as MySQL and understanding that accessing it can lead to **service fingerprinting or enum** is correct. Bonus: attackers might even test for default creds or trigger version-specific exploits if the server is old.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Exactly right.**

> Redirection + SSRF = powerful combo. And yes ‚Äî tools like **Burp Intruder**, **FFUF**, or even **curl in a loop** can help automate the port scan via injection into a `url` param.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **5. Needs a bit more explanation (I'll cover it):**

**Question Recap:**

> *Why would including a full URL (with protocol and port) in a user-controlled parameter allow bypassing firewall rules or accessing internal services?*

### üí° Explanation:

When **you inject a full URL** like:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

into a backend parameter like `url=`, and the server **follows it**, it uses **its own internal network permissions** to connect to that address.

If the server is:

* **Behind a firewall**
* **Sitting in a protected internal network**
* **Allowed to access internal services (like Redis, Memcached, internal APIs)**

‚Ä¶then **you, the external attacker**, are now using the app as a **proxy** to go **where you normally can‚Äôt go**. You're basically **bypassing firewall rules** by **abusing the trust the server has in itself and its own internal network**.

---

### üëä TL;DR of 5:

> If you control the full URL, and the server executes the request from its own network, you bypass external firewall restrictions ‚Äî using the app‚Äôs internal trust to scan or access protected services.

---


### ‚úÖ **1. Payload to override `approved=false` (server uses first instance):**

Your payload:

```
from=alice&to=bob&amount=500%26approved%3dtrue&approved=false
```

‚ùå **Incorrect.**
Here‚Äôs why:
You're injecting `&approved=true` inside the value of `amount`, **but the server uses the *first* instance of a parameter.** So if `approved=false` comes last, it's irrelevant. The injection must come **before** the legitimate parameter to override it.

‚úîÔ∏è **Correct payload:**

```
from=alice&approved=true&to=bob&amount=500&approved=false
```

Since the server takes the first occurrence, `approved=true` wins.

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Server loads Bob's profile ‚Üí handling duplicate parameters:**

Your answer:

> in this case the server is overwriting the previous user value, this behaviour can be noted and used in other sensitive API endpoints.

‚úîÔ∏è **Correct.**
The app is using the **last value** for duplicated parameters. This behavior is valuable in crafting HPP attacks that **override security controls** like roles, user IDs, or access levels.

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Injection fails ‚Üí server uses last occurrence:**

Your answer:

> it strongly suggest the backend server is using last occurrence.

‚úîÔ∏è **Spot on.**
The injected parameter ends up earlier, but the original `clearedfunds=false` is last and **overrides** the injected one. That's exactly how it would behave if it respects the last instance.

---

### ‚úÖ **4. WAF uses first, app uses last ‚Äì why dangerous?**

Your answer:

> attacker can craft payload such that the repeated parameter occurre in the end.

‚úîÔ∏è **Perfectly said.**
This mismatch opens a door to **WAF bypasses**. The WAF thinks `approved=false` (safe), but the app processes `approved=true` later on.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **5. Array-like behavior with `tag` ‚Äì exploitation?**

Your answer:

> hard to tell... maybe try `tag=delete`.

üü° **Partially correct but could be sharper.**
You're on the right track by thinking of testing with something like `tag=delete`.

‚úîÔ∏è Here's a more concrete angle:

* If certain tags **unlock additional logic** (e.g., `tag=admin` shows sensitive reports), the attacker can mix safe tags with **privileged ones**.
* Try chaining tags like:

  ```
  tag=finance&tag=admin&tag=delete
  ```

  And see if the application processes all of them (array behavior), which can leak or modify unintended data.

So yes ‚Äî you nailed the **exploration mindset** here. Just push it a step further with **intent-based payloads.**

---

Solid effort, Pal ‚Äî you're on the right path with most of them, but a few need sharpening for precision and real-world application. Let's review each one critically:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. *"Attacker can override parameter values by passing same parameter with URL encoded `?`..."*

**Correction:** Close, but the key here isn‚Äôt encoding `?`, it‚Äôs **encoding `&`** (as `%26`) to **append new parameters** within an existing parameter's value during the rewrite step.

üß† **Why it works:** The attacker injects a parameter **within a URL path segment** that gets moved into the query string. For example:

```
/pub/user/marcus%26mode=edit
```

gets rewritten as:

```
/inc/user_mgr.php?mode=view&name=marcus&mode=edit
```

The application now sees two `mode` values ‚Äî and depending on platform (e.g., PHP uses last one), the attack wins.

‚úÖ **Final Answer:**

> An attacker can override parameters by injecting URL-encoded characters like `%26` (`&`) into path-based parameters that get translated into query string parameters, causing duplicated parameters to be processed differently on the backend.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. *"Because `?` sign is encoded..."*

**Correction:** Again, it's not `?` being encoded ‚Äî it's `&`. You‚Äôre confusing query string delimiters with parameter injectors.

‚úÖ **Final Answer:**

> The `%26mode=edit` payload works because `%26` decodes to `&`, causing the rewritten URL to include an extra parameter. The web server decodes `%26` before rewriting the URL, resulting in multiple `mode` parameters, allowing the attacker to override the original one.

---

### ‚ùå 3. *"For successful parameter injection, web application should prioritize the first occurrence."*

**Correction:** Opposite logic here.

‚û°Ô∏è Most parameter injection attacks succeed **when the backend uses the ***last*** occurrence of a parameter.**

**Why?**
The attacker injects a malicious version **after** the legitimate one, overriding the secure value.

‚úÖ **Final Answer:**

> For the attack to succeed, the application must process **the last occurrence** of a parameter, allowing the attacker‚Äôs injected value to override the original.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. *"We can bypass WAF with double URL encoding or different encoding schemes."*

**Solid.** Clean and accurate. Double-encoding and alternate separators like `%3b` are classic tricks to evade filters.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. *"If `mode=edit` is successfully injected..."*

**Correct thinking.**
That‚Äôs a real privilege escalation vector. Even if it‚Äôs temporary, attackers can do things like changing emails/passwords, uploading web shells, or pivoting further.

‚úÖ **Refined Answer:**

> If `mode=edit` is successfully injected and processed, the attacker may gain unauthorized access to edit functionalities ‚Äî potentially modifying profiles, changing user data, or escalating privileges depending on how the edit function is implemented.

| - | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Half-correct | Misidentified `?`, needed to focus on `&` encoded as `%26` |
