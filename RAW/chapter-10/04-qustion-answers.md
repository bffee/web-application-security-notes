### ✅ **1. Correct with solid logic.**

> You nailed the core threat: **unvalidated trust** in user-supplied input + misuse of redirection = SSRF, port scanning, and proxy abuse. That’s the whole risk model.

---

### ✅ **2. Correct approach.**

> Detecting with a `url=` parameter is the right first move. Your method of testing various domains and analyzing responses is **textbook black-box validation**.

---

### ✅ **3. Spot-on.**

> Recognizing `3306` as MySQL and understanding that accessing it can lead to **service fingerprinting or enum** is correct. Bonus: attackers might even test for default creds or trigger version-specific exploits if the server is old.

---

### ✅ **4. Exactly right.**

> Redirection + SSRF = powerful combo. And yes — tools like **Burp Intruder**, **FFUF**, or even **curl in a loop** can help automate the port scan via injection into a `url` param.

### ⚠️ **5. Needs a bit more explanation (I'll cover it):**

**Question Recap:**

> *Why would including a full URL (with protocol and port) in a user-controlled parameter allow bypassing firewall rules or accessing internal services?*

### 💡 Explanation:

When **you inject a full URL** like:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

into a backend parameter like `url=`, and the server **follows it**, it uses **its own internal network permissions** to connect to that address.

If the server is:

* **Behind a firewall**
* **Sitting in a protected internal network**
* **Allowed to access internal services (like Redis, Memcached, internal APIs)**

…then **you, the external attacker**, are now using the app as a **proxy** to go **where you normally can’t go**. You're basically **bypassing firewall rules** by **abusing the trust the server has in itself and its own internal network**.

---

### 👊 TL;DR of 5:

> If you control the full URL, and the server executes the request from its own network, you bypass external firewall restrictions — using the app’s internal trust to scan or access protected services.
