### ✅ 1. “User can craft its custom request and can remove and add fields.”

**Perfect.** This is the core mistake most developers make — they assume **users only do what the form lets them do.** But attackers don’t care about the UI — we deal directly with HTTP requests. This one-liner is spot-on.

---

### ✅ 2. “Submitting an empty field is same as submitting the current password field with wrong value. Server makes decision on field presence, not its value.”

You nailed the contrast. But let’s refine:

* `existingPassword=` → Field **exists**, value is empty → app treats it as a failed password.
* Removing the field entirely → app thinks **no validation is needed.**

That’s exactly why attackers **remove both name and value** to manipulate logic, not just input.

---

### ✅ 3. “Developer assumes if specific field does not exist, it's an admin.”

Dead on. This is a **logic flaw based on bad trust assumptions.**

* **Role** should be pulled from the **authenticated session or token**, not **inferred from request structure.**
  This is one of the most common flaws in poorly separated access control.

---

### ✅ 4. “If old password is not required, it suggests either the app is validating via session or it’s poorly designed…”

🔥 Excellent mindset. You’re thinking **defensively and offensively.**
You listed the two possibilities:

* ✅ Proper auth mechanism (like a valid session + role check)
* ❌ Broken logic that just skips validation

And your next step — **"try sending only new password and observe"** — is exactly how you test it in the real world.

---

### ✅ 5. “Application should authenticate user based on session token or out-of-band means.”

Absolutely correct. Let me add a few ideal controls for your arsenal:

#### 🔒 Proper Fixes Developers Should Use:

* **Session-based access control**: Pull role (admin vs. user) from session token, not from form input.
* **Separate endpoints**:

  * `/change-my-password` → requires old password.
  * `/admin/change-user-password` → admin-only route with session-based access control.
* **Backend role validation**: Always enforce roles server-side.

### ✅ Your Answers Reviewed & Upgraded

**1.** ✅ **Forced browsing**

> You nailed the definition. Forced browsing = **manually accessing internal steps or functions without following the intended sequence**.
> 🔧 Extra Layer: It's often used with tools like Burp’s Repeater or Intruder to brute-force or tamper with restricted or hidden functionality. This isn't just skipping steps — it's **redefining the path** to manipulate business logic.

---

**2.** ✅ **Why relying on frontend is risky**

> Perfectly said. Users can control and manipulate everything in the browser:

* Hidden inputs
* JavaScript logic
* Navigation flow

💡 Backend **must** treat frontend data as *untrusted*. If it doesn’t enforce state transitions or validate context (e.g., “Did this order actually get paid for?”), it’s game over.

---

**3.** ✅ **How apps might track stages**
Great answer. Just to strengthen it with categories:

* **Hidden Fields** (e.g., `<input type="hidden" name="step" value="3">`)
* **Cookies** (`cart_progress=step3`)
* **Session Variables** (more secure — but only if enforced server-side)
* **Referer Header** (bad idea — spoofable)
* **Query parameters** (`?step=4`)
  🛑 **Note**: All client-side mechanisms are manipulable — only server-side session enforcement is trustworthy.

---

**4.** ✅ **Signs of bad server-side validation**
Solid reasoning. Here’s how you recognize it quickly during testing:

* You can **manually visit `/delivery` page** after skipping `/payment`, and the app **still accepts input or processes the action**.
* There's **no access denied**, no “Please complete payment first,” no redirect.
* The app uses only **referer/header/cookies** for validation — all spoofable or modifiable.

This means the backend is **not managing application state** securely.

---

**5.** ✅ **Real-world scenarios where skipping steps causes security issues**
Perfect types of features listed. Let me expand a bit:

* **Password reset flow**: If you can skip identity verification and directly hit the password reset page — it’s a takeover.
* **Admin function**: If you skip the login/auth step and directly POST to an admin endpoint, you may access restricted operations.
* **Static content**: If premium content is meant for authenticated users only, but direct access to the file or endpoint works, that’s broken access control — and a **logic flaw in assumption about auth state**.

---

### ✅ 1. “Malicious user can submit POST data in different order which can bypass input validation and overwrite previous step data.”

**Perfect.** You're describing **out-of-sequence parameter tampering**, and you’re recognizing that:

* Backend may expect only specific fields at Step 4.
* But if you inject Step 1 data at Step 4 → it **bypasses validation**, gets stored, and overwrites prior state.

🛡️ **Real-World Attack**: This is how an attacker **rewrites quote prices, tampering risk values** after initial sanitization was already passed in a previous step.

---

### ✅ 2. “Insecure backend only performs checks for current step data. Providing later or previous step data can be stored as-is.”

💡 **Insight level: excellent.**
You understand that most web devs implement **step-specific validation** in a tight scope:

```python
if step == 3:
    validate_field('address')
```

But the backend **doesn’t reject or ignore extra fields**, so:

```http
POST /step3
address=India&premium=5
```

Boom. `premium` isn’t validated (because it’s for Step 1), but it’s still **updated silently**.

🎯 That’s your **parameter smuggling vector**.

---

### ✅ 4. “Server should whitelist the data for each step, enforce validation on each field, and track the steps on backend instead of relying on frontend.”

Absolutely nailed it — **secure design principles** right here:

* **Per-step whitelisting** of parameters → Accept only the expected fields.
* **Always validate ALL inputs** → Don’t trust “step context” alone.
* **Backend-driven step control** → Never trust that the user is on step 4 just because the request says so.

🔥 Bonus advice:

* Use **finite-state machines (FSM)** to model complex flows.
* Tie session state to allowed actions per role and step.

---

### ✅ 5. “I would try providing parameters from previous or later steps...then craft my exploit based on backend behavior.”

👏 **That’s an elite-level pentester methodology.**
You're doing:

* **Step fuzzing**
* **Cross-step injection**
* **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)**
* **State manipulation testing**

Let’s give you an offensive flow diagram:

---

### 🔨 Exploit Chain for These Flaws

1. 🕵️‍♂️ Intercept all multistep requests using a proxy (Burp/ZAP).
2. 📸 Log all parameter names from **each stage** (Step 1 → N).
3. 🔁 Replay Stage N but inject:

   * A field from Step 1
   * A field used by privileged roles
   * Same field multiple times: `premium=500&premium=5`
4. 💣 Observe:

   * Silent overwrites?
   * Stored values without validation?
   * Backend confusion or role bypass?
5. 🎯 Craft your final exploit:

   * Accept own insurance
   * Set arbitrary pricing
   * Inject XSS on staff pages

### ✅ Your Answer 1:

> *Letting a user access the registration form is dangerous—it can overwrite their session object with another user's data if the object is reused across both flows.*

✔️ **Spot on.**
This is the **core mistake**: sharing a session-bound object (`CCustomer`) between **authenticated identity** and **registration state**. The app failed to protect or isolate session identity. That’s what makes the registration form a weapon in a logged-in user’s hands.

---

### ✅ Your Answer 2:

> *A logged-in user can overwrite their session object using someone else’s personal information in the registration form. If accepted, they gain access to that user’s account data.*

✔️ **Perfect articulation.**
It’s a **session confusion attack** triggered through a logic flaw — not an injection, not a privilege escalation in the usual sense, but a **business logic corruption** due to unsegmented session data and reused components.

### 🧪 Extra Tip for Red Team Testing

If you ever find an app that behaves weirdly across flows, try this:

* Log in.
* Visit any **"guest-only" functionality** (registration, forgot password, apply for service).
* Submit altered or spoofed identity info.
* Return to authenticated area and check what changed.

Apps that **don't isolate session components or state machines** will show their cracks there.

---

### ✅ **Answer 3: Watching for Session Changes**

> *If the session token changes after hitting the registration flow, that’s a red flag. Visiting the “My Account” page afterward will confirm whether the session was overwritten.*

✔️ Right on the money.

In properly implemented apps:

* The session token **shouldn't change** arbitrarily.
* But if it **does change unexpectedly** after visiting a page like `/register`, it suggests a **new session object** was spun up or corrupted.
* And if the “My Account” page shows another user’s data... 💀 game over.

---

### ✅ **Answer 4: Different Objects for Different States**

> *Authenticated and unauthenticated users should have separate logic flows and use separate backend objects.*

Absolutely correct ✅

**Key rule**: Don’t cross the streams.

| State           | Session Object Type                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unauthenticated | Temporary/volatile object (e.g., `PendingRegistration`, `SignupData`) |
| Authenticated   | Locked identity object (e.g., `AuthenticatedUser`, `SessionUser`)     |

Merging them = chaos.

Also:

* Registration and password reset flows should **explicitly block** logged-in users.
* Otherwise, you risk session overwrites, identity swaps, or bypasses.

---

### ✅ **Answer 5: Code Reuse Red Flags**

> *Using the same object across both unauthenticated and authenticated flows is a huge red flag. Allowing access to registration while logged in is another design flaw.*

✔️ 100% true.

These are **classic indicators** of a poorly segmented backend:

| 🔴 Red Flag                             | 🚨 Impact                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Same object for both flows              | Identity confusion, session poisoning       |
| No state isolation in session           | Users can pivot between roles mid-session   |
| Registration accessible while logged in | Can be weaponized to overwrite session data |

Developers often "reuse code to save time" but end up **creating logic bombs** that only blow up when a smart attacker strings the pieces together.

---

### ✅ In Summary:

You now understand:

* How session identity works behind the scenes.
* What happens when shared objects are misused.
* How to test for and exploit session poisoning logic flaws.
* What proper session-state and flow segregation should look like.

You’ve mastered this example, no doubt.
