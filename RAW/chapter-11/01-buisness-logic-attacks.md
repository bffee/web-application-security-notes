## 🧠 Section: Attacking Application Logic

### 🔍 What Are Logic Flaws?

Think of logic flaws as the **application "doing the right thing, the wrong way."** These aren’t syntax errors or crashes — the code runs perfectly… it just **doesn’t handle edge cases, weird input, or attacker-controlled workflows** properly.

* In code, logic is:
  `if (X happens) then do Y`.
  Logic flaws come in when no one asked:
  **“What if Z happens?”**

#### 📌 Real-Life Example (Non-technical):

Imagine an airport self-check-in machine. It assumes:

* If a passenger has a boarding pass (A), they’re already security-checked (B), so allow boarding (C).

But no one asked:
**“What if someone gets a boarding pass from a friend?”**

If the logic doesn’t verify the actual ID, it’s a logic flaw — not because the machine is broken, but because it made a flawed assumption.

---

### 🔥 Why Are These Flaws Dangerous?

* No fixed signature like SQLi or XSS — every logic flaw is **custom-made**.
* They **slip past scanners**, because scanners test syntax patterns, not workflows.
* Attackers **love** these because:

  * They’re **hard to detect**
  * Often **let you escalate privileges** or **bypass flows**
  * Usually **aren’t patched properly**

---

### 💡 The Key Idea:

> **Attackers win by thinking differently than developers.**

Developers assume normal users do normal things.
Attackers assume nothing and try everything.

## 🧪 Example-1: "Asking the Oracle"

This one is **gold**. Let’s break it down piece by piece.

---

### 🧩 Context: The App Had Two Features

1. ✅ `RememberMe` cookie: Keeps users logged in.

   * Secure.
   * Encrypted with Triple DES.
   * Includes username, user ID, IP.
   * **High-value**.

2. ✅ `ScreenName` cookie: Stores your visible nickname (like “Hey Marcus!”).

   * Also encrypted (using **same algorithm + key** as above).
   * Low-value, right? You’d think.

---

### 🤨 The Developer's Assumption

> "Well, both cookies need to be encrypted. Why not reuse the same crypto function?"

The developer didn’t realize:

* `ScreenName` is **user-controlled input**.
* Users can see their own decrypted screen name on-screen.
* **BOOM** — you’ve given users access to your encryption function (a.k.a. made the app an **encryption oracle**).

---

### ⚔️ The Attack (Step-by-Step)

#### 📌 Step 1: Information Disclosure (Decryption Oracle)

1. Attacker takes their `RememberMe` cookie (encrypted).
2. Submits it as `ScreenName`.
3. App decrypts it (thinking it’s just a screen name).
4. Shows: `Welcome, marcus|734|192.168.4.282750184`

➡️ Attacker can now **decrypt** values by abusing the `ScreenName` feature.

---

#### 📌 Step 2: Authentication Bypass (Encryption Oracle)

1. Attacker sets `ScreenName` to:
   `admin|1|192.168.4.282750184`

2. Logs out and back in — app encrypts this input using its trusted encryption function.

3. Attacker now gets **encrypted version of admin login data.**

4. Submits this encrypted value as `RememberMe`.

➡️ App **decrypts it**, reads `admin|1|IP`, and logs attacker in as admin.
Even though encryption is strong, the **logic is dumb**.

---

### 💣 Why This Worked

* Reused encryption logic between high-privilege and low-privilege data.
* Exposed the encryption/decryption endpoints to the attacker.
* Didn’t isolate or separate roles of security-sensitive features.

## 🧰 HACK STEPS — How to Find These in the Wild

Here’s your **blueprint**:

---

### 🔎 1. Look for Encryption Use

Anywhere user input gets encrypted or decrypted — not hashed — is a potential target.

#### Example Targets:

* Persistent login tokens
* Password reset links
* Encrypted user settings
* JWT tokens using symmetric encryption

---

### 🔓 2. Look for Oracle Reveal (Decryption Oracle)

> Can I **send encrypted data**, and see the **decrypted result** somewhere?

#### What to do:

* Replace a known encrypted value with another (like `RememberMe` in `ScreenName`)
* Look for:

  * Error messages
  * Displayed values
  * Hidden fields
  * Debug output

---

### 🔐 3. Look for Oracle Encrypt (Encryption Oracle)

> Can I **send plaintext**, and receive the **encrypted version** back?

#### What to do:

* Find input that the app encrypts and stores (like `ScreenName`)
* Supply crafted input (like `admin|1|ip`)
* Log out, capture the encrypted result
* Use it in a more privileged context

## 🧠 Practice Questions (Chapter 11, Part 1)

1. **What makes logic flaws harder to detect compared to SQLi or XSS?**
2. **Why is using the same encryption function across different features dangerous?**
3. **In the “Asking the Oracle” attack, what makes the app act as an encryption oracle?**
4. **What’s the difference between an encryption oracle and a decryption oracle?**
5. **If you found a cookie like `auth_token` that's base64 encoded — what would be your approach to test for logic flaws?**

---

## 🧪 Lab Setup Idea

Wanna replicate this logic flaw? Here's a test lab suggestion:

* Build a Flask app with:

  * `/rememberme` cookie with encrypted data
  * `/set_screenname` route that stores user input as an encrypted cookie
  * `/dashboard` that decrypts and displays screen name
  * Same key and encryption logic used in both cookies

Then try feeding the encrypted screen name into the remember me cookie — boom, you’ve got your own oracle lab.

Let’s move to the **next section** when you’re ready. If you want, I can generate this lab in code too.
