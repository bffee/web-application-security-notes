## üß† Logic Flaw Example 3: Proceeding to Checkout 

---

### üß© Functionality: Normal Purchase Flow

Think of a typical online store (Amazon-style). The checkout process is meant to follow these **4 ordered steps**:

1. **Add to Cart**
2. **Review Cart & Finalize Order**
3. **Enter Payment Info**
4. **Enter Delivery Info**

The developer‚Äôs brain thinks:

> *‚ÄúIf the user reached step 4 (delivery), then of course they must have paid in step 3.‚Äù*

üî¥ **WRONG.** That‚Äôs a dangerous assumption when the attacker **controls the flow.**

---

### üí• The Flawed Assumption

> The app trusted the **user‚Äôs navigation flow** to enforce business rules.

But in reality:

* Users **can skip steps**.
* Users **can re-order steps**.
* Users **can directly hit any internal URL or endpoint**.

That‚Äôs called **forced browsing** ‚Äî and it‚Äôs devastating when your backend doesn‚Äôt enforce **state consistency**.

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è The Attack ‚Äî Step-by-Step

#### üßë Attacker's Plan:

* Browse products (Step 1)
* Finalize order (Step 2)
* **SKIP payment (Step 3)** entirely
* Go straight to **delivery entry (Step 4)**

#### ‚úÖ What happens:

If the backend logic doesn‚Äôt check:

* Whether payment was made,
* Or verify that the order is in a ‚Äúpaid‚Äù state‚Ä¶

‚û°Ô∏è The attacker **gets a confirmed order without paying.**
The order is shipped. The company loses money.

This is not just a business logic flaw ‚Äî it‚Äôs **financial fraud** due to poor flow validation.

---

### üîÑ Real-World Analogy

Imagine this:

* A nightclub requires you to pay at the entrance (Step 1).
* Then gives you a wristband to get drinks inside (Step 2).
* But the bartender just checks for the wristband and assumes you paid.

Now, suppose the bouncer steps away ‚Äî you just walk in through the side and go straight to the bar. You **never paid**, but you get the drinks.

That‚Äôs **forced browsing**.

## üß∞ HACK STEPS ‚Äî How to Force Browse Like a Hacker

This is your offensive checklist when dealing with multistage flows like checkout, password reset, or account creation.

---

### üîé Step 1: Break the Expected Sequence

Try all of the following:

* Skip a step (e.g., go from step 1 to 4).
* Repeat a step.
* Go backwards (step 4 ‚Üí 2).
* Replay a step with altered parameters.

You're not just submitting forms ‚Äî you're probing **how state is tracked**.

---

### üîé Step 2: Understand the Flow Mechanism

Multistage flows can be handled in two ways:

* üü¢ **Different URLs** for each step (e.g., `/payment`, `/delivery`)
* üîµ **Same URL** with different parameters or hidden fields (e.g., `/checkout?step=3`)

Your job is to:

* **Capture all requests (GET, POST)** using Burp or ZAP.
* **Map the flow**.
* Try to **inject or tamper with stage transitions** manually.

---

### üîé Step 3: Think Like the Developer (So You Can Break Their Assumptions)

Ask yourself:

* What **must** the developer be assuming about state?
* Are they **tracking payment status** in a server-side session?
* Or are they just trusting the frontend to lead the user through the right path?

If the app only checks:

> *‚ÄúOh, you're at delivery page, so you must have paid.‚Äù*

‚Ä¶you win.

---

### üîé Step 4: Watch for Broken States

When you mess with flow, the app might:

* Throw debug errors
* Leave variables uninitialized
* Process incomplete objects (e.g., shipping info with no billing info)
* Show strange or privileged behavior

This lets you dig deeper ‚Äî or even craft a custom path through the app that bypasses security.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BONUS TIP:

> This logic flaw is structurally **similar to access control vulnerabilities.**

For example:

* A user might only be allowed to **generate an invoice after payment.**
* But if the app allows **direct access to the invoice page** by skipping checks, that‚Äôs a privilege escalation.

This overlaps heavily with what you saw in **Chapter 8 (Access Control Flaws).**

## üß† Practice Questions (Example 3)

1. **What is forced browsing, and how does it differ from normal navigation?**
2. **Why is relying on frontend navigation logic risky in multistage processes?**
3. **What are two different technical ways an app might track checkout stages?**
4. **What are signs that the app might not be validating state transitions server-side?**
5. **Give a real-world scenario (outside of e-commerce) where skipping steps could lead to a logic flaw.**

## üß™ Lab Setup Idea

Wanna build your own vulnerable flow?

1. Create a simple web app with:

   * Step 1: Add items
   * Step 2: Confirm order
   * Step 3: Payment
   * Step 4: Delivery Info

2. Use cookies or hidden fields to track progress (bad practice ‚Äî intentionally weak).

3. Skip Step 3 and submit delivery in Step 4.

If the app proceeds with no server-side state checks‚Ä¶
‚û°Ô∏è You've built your own logic flaw lab.
