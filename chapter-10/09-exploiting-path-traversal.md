# Exploiting Traversal Vulnerabilities

Once a path traversal vulnerability is confirmed, it can often be escalated depending on whether it grants **read** or **write** access to the serverâ€™s filesystem. In both cases, the attacker's access level is typically equivalent to that of the **web server process**, which may vary in privilege depending on configuration.

### Read Access Exploitation

Read-based traversal flaws allow attackers to extract sensitive files that may directly aid exploitation or help refine future attacks.

* **System and Application Password Files**:
  * Retrieve `/etc/passwd`, shadow files, or credential stores from application-level components.

* **Configuration Files**:
  * Expose details about database connections, file paths, API keys, or misconfigurations that can be chained into further attacks.

* **Include Files**:
  * Often contain hardcoded credentials or security logic that can be reverse engineered.

* **Application Data Files**:
  * Extract contents of XML, JSON, or raw database files used by the application for internal logic or storage.

* **Source Code Disclosure**:
  * Review server-executable files such as:
    ```
    GetImage.aspx?file=GetImage.aspx
    ```
  * Allows attackers to identify logic flaws, insecure function calls, or hardcoded secrets.

* **Log Files**:
  * May contain sensitive user activity, session tokens, or internal errors.

### Write Access Exploitation

With write access, attackers should aim to escalate to **arbitrary command execution** by writing payloads into executable contexts or altering behavior-critical files.

* **User Startup Scripts**:
  * Drop malicious files into directories like `/home/user/.bashrc` or startup folders to execute code on next login.

* **Modify Service Scripts**:
  * Alter files such as `in.ftpd` or cron jobs to execute attacker-controlled commands.

* **Web Shell Upload**:
  * Write a malicious script to a web-accessible directory (e.g., `/var/www/html/shell.php`) and trigger it via HTTP request:
    ```
    http://target.com/shell.php?cmd=id
    ```

### Key Consideration

* The success of these attacks depends on the **permissions of the web server process**, and whether execution is allowed in the target location.
* Always test write-based attacks cautiously to avoid unintentional service disruption.
