# Chapter 3: Web Application Technologies

## ðŸ§  Overview
This chapter provides a deep dive into the core technologies that power web applications. It explores the HTTP protocol, server-side and client-side components, encoding schemes, cookies, headers, remoting/serialization frameworks, and browser extension technologies. Understanding these is foundational for identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities.

## The HTTP Protocol

### ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
- Stateless, text-based protocol.
- Operates over TCP/IP (default port 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
- Every request is initiated by the client and responded to by the server.

---

### HTTP Requests
- Structure:
  - **Request Line**: method + resource + protocol version (e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`)
  - **Headers**: key-value metadata
  - **Body**: (used in methods like POST)

- Common Methods:
  - `GET`: Retrieve resource
  - `POST`: Submit data
  - `PUT`, `DELETE`: Used in RESTful APIs
  - `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `CONNECT`: Less common, sometimes exploited

---

### HTTP Responses
- Structure:
  - **Status Line**: protocol version + status code + reason
  - **Headers**
  - **Body** (e.g., HTML page)

- Status Codes:
  - 2xx: Success (`200 OK`)
  - 3xx: Redirection (`302 Found`)
  - 4xx: Client error (`403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`)
  - 5xx: Server error (`500 Internal Server Error`)

---

## HTTP Headers

### Important Request Headers
- `Host`: Target hostname.
- `User-Agent`: Browser/app making request.
- `Accept`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Accept-Language`: Client preferences.
- `Cookie`: Sends cookies stored in browser.
- `Referer`: Previous page URL (used in CSRF defenses).
- `Authorization`: Credentials for HTTP authentication.
- `X-Forwarded-For`: Indicates original IP in proxied environments.

### Important Response Headers
- `Set-Cookie`: Instructs browser to store a cookie.
- `Content-Type`: MIME type of response body.
- `Location`: Redirect target.
- `Cache-Control`, `Expires`: Caching instructions.
- `Content-Encoding`: e.g., gzip compression.
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforces HTTPS.

---

## Cookies

### Behavior & Structure
- Sent from server via `Set-Cookie`.
- Stored by browser and sent automatically on matching future requests.
- Not sent until explicitly set by server.

### Attributes
- `Domain`, `Path`, `Expires`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`

### Security Implications
- Can be stolen via XSS or modified by attackers unless integrity protected.

---

## HTTPS
- HTTP over TLS; protects integrity and confidentiality in transit.

---

## HTTP Proxies
- Tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP allow interception and modification.

---

## Web Functionality

### Server-Side Technologies (Complete)
[...detailed server-side section with Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, ColdFusion, Perl, Go...]

### Client-Side Technologies
[...detailed explanation of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, AJAX, storage, vulnerabilities...]

---

## State and Sessions
- Stateless nature of HTTP â†’ Sessions via cookies, hidden fields, URL params.
- Secure, unique session tokens needed.

---

## Encoding Schemes
- URL, HTML, Unicode, Base64, Hex â€” used for safe data transmission or exploited for obfuscation.

---

## Remoting and Serialization Frameworks
- JSON, XML, SOAP, AMF, ViewState, Java Serialization
- Targets for XXE, insecure deserialization, hidden field tampering

---

## Browser Extension Technologies
- ActiveX, Flash, Java Applets, modern browser extensions
- Security risks: high privilege access, insecure storage, traffic interception

---

## Same-Origin Policy (SOP)
[...full SOP section covering origin rules, whatâ€™s restricted, whatâ€™s allowed, workarounds, testing...]

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
Understanding web application technologies is foundational to all security testing. These components and behaviors â€” from the HTTP protocol to state management, encoding, and SOP â€” represent the core of what attackers target and defenders must protect.
